# entropywins.wtf website

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JeroenDeDauw/entropywins.wtf.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/JeroenDeDauw/entropywins.wtf)

This repo contains the resources of the [entropywins.wtf website](https://entropywins.wtf).

The website uses the [Silex](silex.sensiolabs.org/) PHP micro-framework.

For developing, you can simply run `php -S 0:8000` in `www`. No need to have a real server
set up.
