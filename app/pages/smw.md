# Semantic MediaWiki

#### My current involvement

I am maintainer and release manager of Semantic MediaWiki. This is done in my free time on a
volunteer basis. My focus nowadays lies on long term sustainability of the platform. Most of my
time goes to enhancing quality, both internal code quality, and external product quality, though
code review and support of contributors.

I am on the steering committee of the [Open Semantic Data Association](http://opensemanticdata.org/),
which is a non-profit supporting the SMW project. I also represent SMW and Wikidata on the
[PHP Framework Interoperability group](http://www.php-fig.org/).
<br /><br />

#### My historical involvement

In 2009 I did a [Google Summer of Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code)
project mentored by SMW veteran [Yaron Koren](http://yaronkoren.com/). This project
ended in the creation of the [Maps](https://github.com/JeroenDeDauw/Maps/blob/master/README.md)
and [Semantic Maps](https://github.com/SemanticMediaWiki/SemanticMaps/blob/master/README.md)
extensions. Following this I did various volunteer and consulting work on SMW and associated
extensions, and eventually ended up managing its releases. As Markus stopped being active in
the project, I took over the maintenance torch.

You can find me in the [contributors list on Ohloh](https://www.ohloh.net/p/smw/contributors).
