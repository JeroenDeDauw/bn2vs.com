# Software Craftsmanship

I am an advocate of Software Craftsmanship and the Clean Code movement.

I am a signatory of the [Software Craftsmanship manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/)
and wear a green [Clean Code band](http://butunclebob.com/files/images/Green%20Band.jpg) as symbol
of my dedication to professionalism. I am also a voting representative on the [PHP Framework
Interoperability Group](http://www.php-fig.org/) to promote good standards in the PHP world.

In building enterprise applications it is paramount to follow professional development techniques
and methodologies. Creating something that is badly designed and barely functions might work at
first, though is not sustainable in big projects. The knowledge of how to design software well and
avoid common pitfalls, is while well understood, not widespread enough into the software development
industry.
