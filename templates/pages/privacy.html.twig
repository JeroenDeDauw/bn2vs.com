        <h3>Google Analytics</h3>

        <p>Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Ireland Limited (&quot;Google&quot;)
            is used on this website. The use includes the &quot;Universal Analytics&quot; operating mode. This makes it
            possible to assign data, sessions and interactions across multiple devices to a pseudonymous user ID and
            thus analyze a user's activities across devices.
        </p>

        <p>Google Analytics uses &quot;cookies&quot;, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website
            analyze how users interact with the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this
            website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, if IP anonymisation
            is activated on this website, Google will reduce your IP address within Member States of the European Union
            or in other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area beforehand. We would like to point
            out that on this website Google Analytics has been extended to include IP anonymisation in order to ensure
            anonymous collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking). The IP address transmitted by your browser in
            the context of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data. For more information on terms of use
            and data protection, please visit <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html</a>

            website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide the website operator with other services
            related to website and Internet use.
