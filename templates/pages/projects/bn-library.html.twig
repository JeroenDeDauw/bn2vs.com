# BN+ Library
This page is about a library I wrote during my highschool years, between 2008 and 2010.
Both the contents of this page and the library it describes have not been updated since.

BN+ Library is a .Net library containing multiple classes, controls and dialogues that
can enrich your application in various ways. It's written in vb.net, using .Net framework
4, is designed for WinForms applications and is completely open source and available
under the GNU General Public License.
