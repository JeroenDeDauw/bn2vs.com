# BN+ Converter Pro

This page is about a tool I created during my high school years, from 2007 to 2010. It's the first
real application I developed and maintained for more than a few weeks.

BN+ Converter Pro, previously known as Binary Converter, is a multi featured converter for Microsoft
Windows. It has been written By Jeroen De Dauw with Microsoft's .Net framework. It allows easy
conversion of various kinds of notations, including hashing of text, ASCII based notations in plain
ASCII, HEX and binary, mathematical conversions from one numeral system to another, block cyphers,
public-key encryption, obfuscation and codecs. A range of tools to modify text are also available.
This application uses BN+ Library, an open source .Net utilities library.

## Download

* [1.1.0 installer (zip)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bncpro/files/1.1.0/BN%2B%20Converter%20Pro.zip/download)

## Usage

### Installation, start-up
You can choose to download the direct run file, or the fully integrated setup. When downloading the direct run file, just un-archive it (with WinRar), and run it. The application will start without any further user interaction needed. You can put the direct run file on your usb, and run it anywhere you like, without needing administration privileges.
If you download the fully integrated setup, you should un-archive it (with WinRar), and run the setup file. The setup will show you several dialogues, including one where you can choose the installation location. When finishing the setup, a short cut to the application will be placed on your desktop, and in your start menu, from which you can run it.

### Use of the interface

The interface is build up out of a menu, a tab container, and a status bar. The Tools menu contains a variety of handy tools that will effect the text of the text field that has focus (see section 8 ). To switch tabs, just click the tab you want to open. Each tab page contains a type of conversion or encryption engine, and the last one contains the application options (see section 8 ).

### Text converter

You can find the text conversion module on the tab page "Text converter". This converter enables you to translate text to or from binary, ascii, or hex. You can change the delimiters in the options tab (see section 8 ). The text entered in the upper field will be encoded/decoded and the result will appear in the lower field. You can switch the fields by clicking 'Toggle fields' in the Tools menu (see section 9), or by using the hot key ctrl + down. When you translate a very large amount of text, then the converter interface will be replaced by a progress dialogue. This dialogue will show you the status of the conversion (in percentage), and enable you to immediately quite the translation.

### Math converter

You can find the math conversion module on the tab page "Math converter". This converter enables you to instantly convert values from any numerical system to the notation of any other. Enter the value you want to convert in the corresponding field, and the corresponding values will appear in the other fields. This version also features a new feature, which is the possibility to convert completely custom numerical systems. To set one of these, click 'set custom 1' or 'set custom 2', and enter the symbols representing each value. The first character will be the zero value, so to convert to the decimal system, you should enter '0123456789', and not something like '1234567890', which is a completely different notation.

### Hash encrypter

You can find the hash encrypter on the tab page "Hash encrypter". This encrypter enables you to hash text. Hit one of the buttons above the text field to translate to the corresponding hash.

### Crypt tool

You can find the crypt tool on the tab page "Crypt tool". The crypt tool enables you to encypt or decrypt messages. The available algorithms can be divided into 3 categories, which are listed below.

### Block ciphers

A block cipher is a symmetric key cipher which operates on fixed-length groups of bits, termed blocks, with an unvarying transformation. When encrypting, a block cipher might take (for example) a 128-bit block of plain text as input, and output a corresponding 128-bit block of ciphertext. The exact transformation is controlled using a second input
