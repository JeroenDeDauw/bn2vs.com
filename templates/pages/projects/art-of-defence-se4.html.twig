        Art of Defence SE4 is a [Command and Conquer Generals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer:_Generals)
        map. It was originally created in 2006 by an unknown author, then vandalized by people to
        make it easier to win, and recovered by me in 2008. I released dozens of new updates, each
        adding more depth to the map, making it more balanced, and more fun to play.

        ## Map info

        AoD map with "don't let them reach the end line" principle. You need to kill the units of the bot before they
        reach the end of the road. The attacks consist out of 20 waves of increasingly powerful units, followed by 2
        bosses. You can change the difficulty of the map by setting the bot to normal, hard or brutal. Normal is
        playable by novices, hard is a good challenge for experienced players, and brutal is for the AoD veterans.

        * Min players: 1
        * Max players: 4
        * Playable via Multiplayer and Skirmish
        * Bot needs to be GLA

        ## Tips

        * Don't forget your anti air!
        * Make money at the start of the game, you won't need a lot of defences for the first few waves!
        * Play as a team! Defend all at the same place, and spread your units and buildings over the whole map.
        * When playing brutal, you'll only win after the second boss is death, so don't concentrate on the waves of jets. Also be ready for a surprise!

        Unfortunately most of gameplay videos from this map (and CCG in general) got deleted together
        with the rest of my old YouTube account.
